# Kaiburr Task 1 - Java Backend REST API

## Introduction

This repository contains my implementation for Task 1 of the Kaiburr assessment. The goal was to create a Java backend that manages tasks, allows CRUD operations, and executes shell commands, with all results stored in MongoDB. Everything here is built and documented by me, as per the assignment guidelines.

## Project Overview

The backend is built with Spring Boot and uses MongoDB to store task information. Each task can be created, updated, deleted, searched by name, and executed. Executions are logged with timestamps and output for later review.
